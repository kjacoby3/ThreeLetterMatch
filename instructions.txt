How To Play
====================================
Commands:
    Set - Sets a 3-letter substring to match words to. Ex: "set abc"
    Submit - Submits a word to compare to the substring. Ex: "submit hello"
    List - Lists all the words in the dictionary that match your substring. A "1" is used to mark the words you guessed correctly.
    Quit - Stop playing the game and display your final score
    Scoreboard - Lists all of the words you already correctly guessed.
====================================
To start playing, you should use the set command to set a 3-letter substring. Once
your substring is set, submit words that contain the substring to score points. A
point is earned for each unique word that you submit that matches the substring and
that is in the dictionary. A point is lost for each word submitted that does not
contain the substring or does not exist in the dictionary. The list command can be
used to reference the library to see all words that contain your substring, doing
this will end your game, however.
